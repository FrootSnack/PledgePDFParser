# Pledge PDF Parser

A simple command-line PDF parser for the conversion of automatically-generated pledge report documents into a more easily-analyzable TSV (tab-separated values) format.

This project successfully transformed a tedious 20-minute-minimum data entry task into a 2-minute process of inputting the PDF, grabbing the data, and fixing up any (minor) errors.
